# RSNA_PneumoniaDetection
Pneumonia Detection from X-ray images provided by RSNA organization

Hey guys,

Me and my friends have created this program for a Kaggle Challenge to detect Pneumonia from X-Ray images.
So basically we have used Deep Learning algorithm call Mask R-CNN which does pixel wise object detection and makes a bounding boxe on a images based on training images.
For backbone, we have used ResNet-101 Architecture which is a ConvNet.
We have used dataset provided by Kaggle and used Google Colab which is a online GPU for running machine learning and deep learning codes.

Enjoy!
