# RSNA_PneumoniaDetection
Pneumonia Detection from X-ray images provided by RSNA organization


Our team worked on a Kaggle Challenge to detect Pneumonia from X-Ray images.
We have used Mask R-CNN which outputs a mask bounding box if the X-Ray image has an infected area.
For backbone, we have used ResNet-101 Architecture which is a ConvNet.
We have trained the model using dataset provided by Kaggle and used Google Colab which is a online GPU for running machine learning and deep learning code.

Enjoy!
